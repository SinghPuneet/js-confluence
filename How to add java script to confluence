Confluence provides the ability to include JavaScript codes either inside the Custom HTML or HTML macro. 
Applying the JavaScript inside the Custom HTML will enforce the script to be loaded in site-wide. 
However, applying the JavaScript inside the HTML macro will only trigger the script in a specific page in which the macro is placed.
